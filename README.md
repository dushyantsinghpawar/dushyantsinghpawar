- *BI & Visualization:* Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit, Matplotlib
- *Collaboration & Tooling:* Git, GitHub, GitHub Projects, Markdown, Linux, Bash scripting

**Selected Projects:**
- *AWS Serverless Pipeline* — Event-driven file ingestion with Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, retries, and DLQs; processes files in under 3 seconds at less than one dollar per month.
- *EngageTrack Analytics* — Real-time learning analytics dashboard (Flask, React, PostgreSQL) with 92% accuracy and sub-200ms query latency for 100+ users.
- *ChartMind AI* — Lightweight chart interpretation service (Python, OpenCV, Docker) reaching 85% accuracy on 500+ test samples; reduces manual analysis time by 60%.
- *QuickAPI* — Production-ready FastAPI backend with JWT authentication, ML prediction service, audit logging, Docker, and CI/CD automation.
- *LSTM Stock Predictor* — Reproducible LSTM training/inference with CLI and planned Gradio UI; includes training and prediction pipelines.
